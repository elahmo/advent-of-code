# advent-of-code

This is my collection of solutions for the [Advent of Code](http://adventofcode.com) competition that runs every year. For now, solutions for the 2018 version are going to be added as the time progresses.

The solutions are written in the *notebook* file. After 2018, I will finish the previous versions from past years and add them this repository as this seems like a great idea to work daily on short problem sets.

View the current solutions [here](http://nbviewer.jupyter.org/github/elahmo/advent-of-code/blob/master/Advent-of-Code-2018.ipynb)!
